My first project

## Task 1

Write a password generator in Dart. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

## Task 2

Implement a function that validate the correctness of a string
